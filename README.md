Are you a fan of Terraform but forced to use Cloudformation due to organizational or technical reasons? Introducing **cfnctl**, a CLI that brings the Terraform cli experience to Cloudformation. You'll never need to use the AWS Console for managing stacks anymore!

With *cfnctl*, you write Cloudformation templates as usual but use the cli workflow that you are already used to from Terraform, including:

* **apply**
* **plan**
* **destroy**
* **output**
